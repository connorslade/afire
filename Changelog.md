# 3.0.0

Coming Soon

- The thread pool can now be resized at runtime.
- `Server::start_threaded` has been replaced with `Server::workers` to set the number of worker threads and the normal `Server::start`.
- Supply a context to all route handlers.
  The context contains a reference to the server, request, and acts as a response builder.
  Note: This also allows access to the thread_pool for both executing tasks and resizing it.
- Remove the `stateful_route` method, use normal routes with `ctx.app()` instead.
- You can now send responses before the route handler ends.
  This allows you to easily send a response and then do some work after the response is sent as to not block the client.
- Responses can be sent from other threads.
  You will have to notify the handler that you will be sending a response after the handler function returns with `ctx.guarantee_will_send()`.
- Allow returning any error type from route handlers.
  This is done with a return type of `Result<(), Box<dyn Error>>`.
- Allow attaching extra context to an error with [anyhow](https://crates.io/crates/anyhow) like functions: `context`, `with_context`, `status`, `with_status`, `header`, `with_header`.
- Remove `StartupError::NoState` error.
- Make `ForceLockMutex`, `ForceLockRwLock`, and `SingleBarrier` public through the `internal::sync` module.
  - The force lock traits are used to lock a `Mutex` or `RwLock` even if it is poisoned.
  - The `SingleBarrier` is used to have a thread wait until another thread unlocks the barrier.
    The difference from a normal Barrier is that it does not block on both sides, only the waiting side.
- Replace the `TcpStream` in `Request` with `Socket`, a wrapper struct.
  Its used to allow automatically the barrier with a response is sent.
  In the future it might also be used for optional TLS support.
- Move path parameters into Context and use a HashMap instead of a Vec.
- Parse the HTTP version into an enum instead of a string.
- Properly determine weather to use keep-alive or not.
  In HTTP/1.1 keep-alive is opt-out, but previous versions of afire assumed it was opt-in.
  Fixing this produced a 2x performance increase in the benchmarks I ran.
  Now, this is still only a ~500us improvement but hey.
- Filter CLRF characters from headers. This prevents a potential [response splitting attack](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7230#section-9.4).
- Properly disallow HTTP/1.1 requests with no Host header.
- Added a new ResponseBody type of Empty.
- Added a `current_thread` function to the threadpool.
- Catch panics at the thread-pool level, not the route handler level.
  This will ensure that a worker will not die, even if internal afire code panics.
- Use an Arc instead of a Rc for `HandleError::Panic`
- Add `with_response` function on Context to overwrite the response.
- Finish implementing Websockets. :tada:
- Add chat app example application.
- Rename `Server::start` to `Server::run` to emphasize that it blocks.
- Pass `Arguments` to trace formatters instead of a String.
  This can be more efficient if the formatter decides not to format the trace.
- Attach a unique ID to each socket.
- Disallow [forbidden headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Forbidden_header_name) as default headers.
- Rename `extension` module to `extensions`.
- Added a RouteShorthand extension.
  It allows you to use `server.get(...)` instead of `server.route(Method::GET, ...)`.
- Added Redirect shorthand extension.
  It allows you to use `ctx.redirect("...")` instead of `ctx.status(Status::Found).header(HeaderType::Location, "...")`.
- Rewrote the router to allow for more compacted routes.
  Parameters and wildcards no longer have to be separated by a slash, they can be separated by any literal.
  This was not implemented before because it it significantly more complicated [to implement](/lib/internal/router.rs).
  Here are some examples of what you can do now:
  - `/file/{name}.{ext}`
  - `/hello*world`
- Internal `url::decode` will not hard fail in the case of invalid url encoded strings.
- Add `PathNormalizer` middleware that removes trailing and repeating slashes from paths.
- Optimize router. Benchmarking is kinda hard but I _think_ this new router is faster even though it is significantly more flexible.
- Rename HeaderType to HeaderName as that is the correct name.
- Accept `Into<Header>` in `Context::header` and `Response::header`.
- Create 'header structs' that can be converted into a `Header` and simplify working with headers in responses.
- Use [loopback](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1122), [private](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918), and [unique local](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4193) addresses for RealIp
- Add is_informational, is_success, is_redirect, is_client_error, and is_server_error methods on status codes.
- Use a Cow in HeaderName::Custom
- Don't store whole stream to get its length in Head ext
- Added sync_route extension
- Make threadpool more robust
- Add a Stream trait to allow using different socket impls
- Allow using custom event loop
  - The custom event loop with the Stream trait should allow a separate crate to add tls support to an afire server
- Cleanup Query struct
  - Now stores a set of QueryParameter structs instead of [String; 2]
  - Implement Debug for Query
  - Rename `Query::from_body` to `Query::from_str`
- Made internal::handle::handle function public for use in custom event loops.
- Made `error::AnyResult` public
- Disable keep-alive if only running with one thread
- Set default worker count to 16
- Create the Server with a builder
- Store config fields like host, default headers, etc. in a ServerConfig struct
- Add Server::run_async to start the server on a separate thread and get a ServerHandle, which can be used to access the server state or shutdown the server.

# 2.2.1

August 20, 2023

- Properly support `ErrorKind::Interrupted` on streaming responses (#46).
  Previously if a Reader returned any error, afire would just print an error and close the socket.

# 2.2.0

July 02, 2023

- Use binary search on ServeStatic MMIE types (save those clock cycles)
- Some optimizations throughout afire
- Logger can now make use of the `RealIp` extension and log the real ip of the client
- Logger now holds a persistent file handle instead of opening and closing it every time
- In ServeStatic, when paths have the '..', they will now go up a directory instead of being ignored
  Note: The highest you can can go is the data directory that you define, so there is no path traversal vulnerability
- Accept `impl Into<HeaderType>` in `RequestId::new` instead of just `AsRef<str>`.
  This allows for using `HeaderType`s as well as strings to set the header.
- Add a `HEAD` middleware that adds support for the HTTP HEAD method.
- Update `ServeStatic` to send a Content-Length header when streaming a file.
- Add a `TRACE` middleware that adds support for the HTTP TRACE method.
- Add support for [Server-Sent Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events) (SSE).
- Progress on Websocket support
