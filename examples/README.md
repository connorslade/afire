## Applications

### [Basic](basic)

Shows the very basics of afire:

- Creating routes
- Creating and using Middleware
- Server state
- Accepting JSON requests
- Accepting
- Responding with JSOn

### [Pastebin](paste_bin)

A simple pastebin, but a more complete example.
Shows how to use a database, render templates, create api routes, accept form data, handle shutdowns, and more.
I have actually made a real pastebin with afire ([plaster-box](https://github.com/connorslade/plaster-box)), but because I started on it so long ago I prefer some of the practices used in this example.
