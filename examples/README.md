## Basic

Basic examples give you a nice and simple first look into using afire.
Run `cargo r --example basic` to use the example picker menu thing.
You can also run a specific example with `cargo r --example basic -- <EXAMPLE_NAME>`.
The source code for each basic example can be found within the `basic` subdirectory in a file with the same name as the example.
