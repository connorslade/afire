Below is a super simple example so you can see the basics of afire syntax.

```rust no_run
// Import Lib
use afire::{Server, Method, Response, Header, Content};

// Create Server
let mut server = Server::<()>::new("localhost", 8080);

// Add a route
server.route(Method::GET, "/greet/{name}", |ctx| {
  let name = ctx.param("name");

  ctx.text(format!("Hello, {}", name))
      .content(Content::TXT)
      .send()?;

  Ok(())
});

// Start the server
server.run().unwrap();
```
