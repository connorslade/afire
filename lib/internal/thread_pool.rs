//! A resizable thread pool implementation.
//! Used for handling multiple connections at once.
//!
//! You can access the thread pool from within a route handler with `ctx.server.thread_pool`.
//! With this, you can resize the thread pool, get the current thread id, or execute a job on the thread pool.
//! To get the current thread id, use [`ThreadPool::current_thread`].
//! To execute a job on the thread pool, use [`ThreadPool::execute`].
//! To resize the thread pool, there are a few different functions:
//! - [`ThreadPool::resize_exact`] - Resizes the thread pool to the specified size.
//! - [`ThreadPool::increase`] - Spawns a new worker thread, increasing the thread pool size by 1.
//! - [`ThreadPool::decrease`] - Sends a kill message, decreasing the thread pool size by 1.
//!
//! For more information on how the thread pool works, see the documentation for [`ThreadPool`].

/// A thread pool.
///
/// Consists of a number of worker threads, and a channel to send messages to them.
/// When dropping the thread pool, all workers are stopped and joined.
/// When increasing the size of the thread pool, new workers are spawned.
/// When decreasing the size of the thread pool, a kill message is sent on the channel, and when processed, the worker removes itself from the pool.
///
/// Also note each worker has a unique id, which is calculated by incrementing a static counter.
/// This means that even when a worker is removed, the id will not be reused, until the counter overflows I suppose.
///
/// # Example
/// ```
/// # use afire::internal::thread_pool::ThreadPool;
/// let pool = ThreadPool::new_empty();
///
/// pool.increase();
/// pool.execute(|| {
///     println!("Hello from thread pool!");
