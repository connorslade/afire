//! Middleware is code that runs before and after the routes.
//! They can be used to Log Requests, Ratelimit Requests, add Analytics, etc.
//! For more information, see the [Middleware Example](https://github.com/connorslade/afire/blob/main/examples/basic/middleware.rs).

/// Trait used to implement Middleware, which is code that runs before and after the routes - potentially modifying the request and response.
/// You can use Middleware to Log Requests, Ratelimit Requests, add Analytics, etc.

/// There are two types of hooks: raw and non-raw.
/// The raw hooks are passed a [`Result`], and their default implementation calls the non-raw hooks if the Result is Ok.
/// This allows you to handle errors (like page not found), while maintaining a clean API for middleware that doesn't need to handle errors.

/// - [`Middleware::pre_raw`]
/// - [`Middleware::pre`]
/// - [`Middleware::post_raw`]
/// - [`Middleware::post`]
/// - [`Middleware::end_raw`]
/// - [`Middleware::end`]
